This repo is a set of basic tools for Visual Novel / Game developers who are planning to create a Dating sim.

## Instructions to insert Toolkit in your repo 
I recommend the following ways to include it in your project:
- [**Pull branch**](https://github.com/DonRP/DS-toolkit#pull-branch) (to **insert** it into your game and **update** it easily)
- **Fork** (to improve the repo or create a Toolkit based on mine)

### Pull branch
To **insert** or **update** the Toolkit in your repo with Pull branch I recommend the following procedure:

(only if you want to insert the repo) Create a new empty branch, in the example I'll use **DS-toolkit**

`git checkout DS-toolkit`

`git pull https://github.com/DonRP/DS-toolkit.git tool-only --allow-unrelated-histories`

At the end make a merge inside the arm of the project.
